                    During our years at Springboard, we helped adults break into
                    tech and transform their lives. It was inspiring to see
                    people in their 30s and 40s juggle learning with work and
                    family determined to build have a new career. But one
                    question kept bothering us: why wait until adulthood to
                    learn these skills?
                    <span>
                      We kept thinking: What if kids had access to these
                      opportunities earlier? What if they could explore
                      technologies like AI, blockchain, and product design while
                      their curiosity is at its peak? How much further could
                      they go?
                    </span>

                    That question sparked an idea. And Xelaris was born.
                    <span>
                      We had a different vision: we wanted to create something
                      more than just another coding program. We wanted a
                      platform that introduces kids to the technologies shaping
                      the future, like AI, blockchain, and web3.

                    <span>
                      We started small, growing through word-of-mouth, focusing
                      on quality over scale. Now, with the right systems and a
                      great team, we&apos;re just getting started.
